                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello baby~ Happy National Boyfriend day ! Here's an appreciation letter from me to you! I wont be able to say all the reasons why I love you because there are just way too many since youre such a loving person but I'll describe some of the reasons why I love you! First of all I just wanna say that you're one of the most amazing person I've ever met in my life. I love how youre a very enthusiastic person, you are willing to learn and improve on things you lack at, and that makes me attracted to you. The way you always try to find several ways to solve a problem really intrigues me. I love how you wont see giving up as your first choice! Second of all, you dont judge me but instead accept me for who I am. I appreciate it when you listen to my problems, and you will try your very best to help me get through the problems. You already have so much on your plate but you're sacrifcing your time for me which makes me feel like I'm very important to you and I thank you very much for making me feel special &hearts; You will always make sure I'm feeling okay, make sure that I eat well, you will lend me money or even pay for my food when I don't have enough money to buy even a single meal, you make sure I don't waste my health on instant noodles, because of this you also started making healthier lunch and breakfast for me such as sandwiches and fried rice, you will always make sure that I'm happy and in a good mood and if I'm not, you will try your absolute best to find ways to make me feel better such as tickling me, annoying me with kisses(but i love it), playing the guitar to calm me down, reading dad jokes to me which are really funny (i love it when you laugh to yourself after reading them, you look and sound really cute laughing while reading the jokes on your phone), you will make sure that i drink enough water everyday and there are a lot more but I'll save them for future purposes XD. I love the way your eye wrinkles when you smile or laugh, you look so cute and it puts me in awe &hearts; &hearts; I always think to myself, "Why couldn't have I met you earlier?", but it's okay, I'm glad I still got to meet such an amazing person like you bee~ You also have a very bright personality and you inspire to be better also! I hope we will be able to get through tough moments together, no matter how tough it is... I hope everything will be okay. I wish we can both grow and improve more as we progress in our loving relationship together! God loves us and will be our guide to our tough moments &hearts;! Please stay healthy ! XD. To more memories together bee, honey, yeobo, bee bee, bby, bb, ! I love you so much bby &hearts; &hearts;
