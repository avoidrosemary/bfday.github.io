                How we started:
            </h2>

            <p>
                We met each other on an outing that our mutual friend during that time invited us to. We first met
                in the canteen based on what you said, but i cant remember seeing you hahaha. I first noticed you
                when we were at the bus stop. Us and our other friends, we were waiting for our grab to arrive.
                Ziloong, you and me sat in one car. You sat beside the driver while both me and zl sat behind. The
                whole ride was rather quiet and peaceful. (a bit awkward though XD) We then went to a mamak at PV128
                i think thats the name? You sat beside me. You also ordered sardine roti canai which shocked me
                hahaha (cause i dont like sardine huhu).. not judging though! You do you bby. Anyways we did have
                small talks and people started shooting lime seeds out from the straw which was really disgusting
                but whatever lol, it was funny. We all had a great time together ! Thats probably how we started
                becoming friends i think XD &hearts; &hearts;
