                Oh look its when we wore onesies to Atria, for the japanese event (there were so little people so we
                were
                feeling a bit out of place since we were dressed very differently compared to other people AHHAH),
                its
                alright since it was a core memory hehe. We ate at Moim, very delicious but a bit on the pricey
                side, korean
                food! You had jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and i had kimchi bokkeumbap (kimchi fried rice). It
                didn't
                taste like the jjajangmyeon that you had in beewon but you still finished it anywayy. We both shared
                an
                unlimited refill of a cold drink to save money! XD
